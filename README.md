# TechUp 2025 - The BattleBots - Intelligent Claims Optimization System

**Team Lead:** Nick Akincilar  
**Team Members:** Brendan Schultz, Fady Heiba, Jack Roche, Michael Costner, Nick Akincilar

## Project Overview

An intelligent orchestration system that helps healthcare finance teams and insurance providers optimize claims processing to reduce claims denials. Our solution uses AI-powered analysis to validate claims against insurance policy documents, identify potential issues before submission, and generate automated appeals with supporting documentation.

**Vision:** Create a one-stop shop for any sort of insurance claim optimization - applicable to healthcare, auto, homeowners, and other insurance types.

## The Insurance Claims Challenge

### Current Insurance Flow (What We Learned)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Patient/Provider] --> B[Medical Procedure/Service]
    B --> C[Submit Insurance Claim]
    C --> D[Insurance Review]
    D --> E{Claim Decision}
    E -->|Approved| F[Payment Issued]
    E -->|Denied| G[Denial Notice]
    G --> H[Finance Team Manual Review]
    H --> I[Appeal Process]
    I --> J[Re-submission with Documentation]
    J --> D
```

### Key Problems Identified
1. **High Denial Rates**: Claims often denied due to incorrect coding, missing documentation, or misinterpretation of policy rules
2. **Manual Appeals Process**: Finance teams spend significant time manually reviewing denials and crafting appeals
3. **Complex Policy Matching**: Difficulty matching claim details against complex insurance policy documents
4. **Revenue Loss**: Denied claims represent lost revenue that requires time-intensive recovery processes

## Our Solution: Intelligent Claims Optimization

### What Our Project Does in the Flow

Our system intercepts and enhances the claims process at multiple points:

1. **Pre-Submission Validation**: Analyze claims before submission to predict approval likelihood
2. **Denial Analysis**: Automatically process denial notices to identify root causes
3. **Policy Matching**: Use AI to match claim details against insurance policy documents
4. **Automated Appeals**: Generate appeals with supporting documentation and policy references

### Enhanced Flow with Our System

```

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Claims Data Processing**
- **Input**: Structured claim data (XML/JSON format)
- **Content**: Procedure codes, costs, patient information, provider details
- **Processing**: Validation, normalization, code verification

#### 2. **Policy Document Analysis**
- **Document AI Integration**: Process unstructured insurance policy documents
- **Cortex Search**: Fuzzy matching of procedures against policy rules
- **Rule Database**: Structured lookup table for procedure codes and approval criteria

#### 3. **AI-Powered Matching Engine**
- **Code Validation**: Verify correct procedure codes against insurance databases
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Find similar procedures when exact codes don't match
- **Policy Compliance Check**: Match claim details against policy requirements

#### 4. **Automated Response Generation**
- **Appeal Generation**: Create structured appeals with policy references
- **Supporting Documentation**: Compile relevant policy excerpts and justifications
- **Multi-format Output**: Email templates, PDF reports, structured data exports

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit web application with potential for full React frontend
- **Backend**: Python-based processing engine
- **AI/ML**: 
  - Snowflake Cortex for search and LLM capabilities
  - Document AI for unstructured document processing
  - LLMs for natural language processing and response generation
- **Data Storage**: Snowflake for structured data and document storage
- **Document Processing**: PDF/Word document generation and parsing

## Data Requirements

### Primary Data Sources

1. **Claims Data**
   - Patient/provider information
   - Procedure codes and descriptions
   - Cost information
   - Claim submission details

2. **Insurance Policy Documents**
   - Coverage rules and limitations
   - Procedure approval criteria
   - Code-specific requirements
   - Exclusions and exceptions

3. **Procedure Code Database**
   - Standard medical/service codes
   - Code descriptions and categories
   - Insurance-specific code mappings

4. **Denial History**
   - Previous denial notices
   - Appeal outcomes
   - Pattern analysis data

### Sample Data Generation Strategy
- Use Cursor AI to generate realistic claim scenarios
- Create mock insurance policy documents
- Generate PDF denial notices for Document AI processing
- Build synthetic procedure code databases
